h3. Installation
  
h4. Dependencies

Like most software, Cucumber and Webrat depend on other software. Let's install them first.

  sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev
  sudo gem install term-ansicolor treetop diff-lcs nokogiri builder

h4. RSpec

  sudo gem install rspec rspec-rails

h4. Cucumber

  sudo gem install cucumber

h3. Webrat

Webrat is an Ruby-based acceptance testing library for web applications.

You can install Webrat as a gem or as a plugin. The gem is more stable because it follows a release schedule 
instead of seeing every change that is pushed to Github.  

  sudo gem install webrat

  or

  git submodule add git://github.com/brynary/webrat.git vendor/plugins/webrat
  git submodule init

h3. Configuration
  
  script/generate cucumber
