blah. blah.

  h3. Introduction

h2. Textile Examples

Sample Table.

|_. Name|_. Age|_. Height|
|Tom|29|5'9"|
|Chris|27|6'0"|

h4. Pay Attention to my H4

You just don't see enough ordered lists around these days.

# alpha
# beta
# gamma

Unordered lists are nice for when you don't want to prioritize things.

* one
* two
* three

It's always a good idea to quote someone famous so people think you know what you're talking about.

bq. To be or not to be, that is the question

If that doesn't work, just fall back on math equations. That's sure to work. (If the github implementation of textile worked as the textism.com implementation does.)

a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^

Tables are a pain, huh? Just slap in some preformatted content using &lt;pre&gt; tags.

<pre>size   color
 L       G
 M       R
 S       B</pre>

This *is* a code repository so displaying @code@ should be easy and look good too!

  def foo
    puts 'bar'
  end

h2. Sample Header

* apples
** Granny Smith
** Pink Lady
* bananas
* grapes
